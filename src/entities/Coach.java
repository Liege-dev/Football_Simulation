/*
 * Coach - an OBSERVER of the Match.
 *
 * The coach stands on the touchline and listens for goals. After every goal
 * it looks at the score and picks a mentality for its team:
 *   losing             -> ATTACKING  (push the formation up the pitch)
 *   winning by 2+      -> DEFENSIVE  (drop deep and protect the lead)
 *   otherwise          -> BALANCED
 *
 * The coach changes tactics by giving each outfield player a NEW
 * MovementBehaviour (Strategy pattern). So two patterns work together:
 * Observer tells the coach WHEN to act, Strategy is HOW it changes the team.
